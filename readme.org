| [[https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router][ui-router]]       | Required               |
| [[http://chieffancypants.github.io/angular-hotkeys/][angular-hotkeys]] | Optional for shortcuts |

** Example

Running the example

: cd example
: npm install
: httpster

Open up http://localhost:3333

** Installation

: bower install helmsman

Also available in rails-assets just add the following to your Gemfile

: gem 'rails-assets-helmsman'

** Config

1. Make sure you include angularjs, ui.router, angular-hotkeys and helmsman in your project like so;
   : // Angular
   : //= require angular
   : //= require angular-ui-router
   : //= require helmsman

   Note: helmsman build includes angular-hotkeys and mousetrap for shortcut keys.

2. Add the following to your AngularJS app
   : angular.module('app',['ui.router', 'helmsman'])

3. Create a main controller for your base angularjs template
   Example: Here I use a home controller in my default.html angularjs template file.
   : <div ng-controller="HomeController">
   :   <menu-directive menus="menus" location-to-menu="locationToMenu"></menu-directive>
   :   <div id="wrapper" ui-view=""></div>
   : </div>

4. Define your menu in your home controller.

   Basic example one level menu
   :     $scope.menus = {
   :         main: [
   :             {label: "Home",  state: "home"},
   :             {label: "Blog",  state: "blogs"},
   :             {label: "Contact Us",  state: "contactus"},
   :             {label: "About Us",  state: "aboutus"}
   :         ]
   :     }

   Full example with three levels.
   :     $scope.menus = {
   :         main: [
   :             {label: "Costings Menu...",  link: "costings"},
   :             {label: "Settings Menu...",  link: "settings"}
   :         ],
   :         costings:  [
   :             {label: "Main",      breadcrumb: "main"},
   :             {label: "Invoices",  state: "invoices"}
   :         ],
   :         settings:  [
   :             {label: "Main",      breadcrumb: "main"},
   :             {label: "Accounting Menu...",link: "settings_accounting"},
   :             {label: "Account",   state: "account"}
   :         ],
   :         settings_accounting: [
   :             {label: "Main",      breadcrumb: "main"},
   :             {label: "Settings",  breadcrumb: "settings"},
   :             {label: "Profile",   state: "profile"}
   :         ]
   :     }

*** States

Items with a state relate to the ui-router

*** Links

Link to another menu system

*** Breadcrumbs

These are at the top and allows you to step back to another menu, these are placed in order listed in your configuration.

** Update

Run gulp and create build file
: gulp
<edit the helmsman file to trigger>

Use bower and push to repository
- Edit bower.json manually change to new version eg: 0.3.3
- Commit
- Run bower to apply the tag
  : bower version 0.3.3

Push master branch and tags

Now go to rails-assets.org and add
| Name    | helmsman |
| Version | v0.3.3   |

** Shortcut keys

Shortcut keys are dynamically applied. These are ctrl+1 to ctrl+9 for the menu items 1 to 9 and ctrl+- for going to the previous menu. These are displayed next to the menu item and can be hidden and changed via the helmsman-key class.
** Usage

Enter

:  <menu-directive menus="menus" location-to-menu="locationToMenu"></menu-directive>

Where menus and locationToMenu were defined in your main controller, refer to configuration.

** Styling

All classes are namespaced with helmsman

| helmsman-breadcrumb     | Previous menu area                     |
| helmsman-breadcrumb-key | The shortcut key for the previous menu |
| helmsman-heading        | Current menu heading                   |
| helmsman-menu           | Main menu area                         |
| helmsman-key            | The shortcut key per menu item         |
** TODO
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CREATED:  [2016-09-14 Wed 17:28]
   :END:

- [ ] Allow disabled flag which will fade out items in the menu but keep them in position

- [ ] Find a way to split the template back to a html file like we had.
  The problem was when this goes into test/production on a rails server the URL for the template html
  was not being generated correctly.

- [ ] Abolish the need for locationToMenu
  We should be able to look up the state and do a reverse lookup using the hash
